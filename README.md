(NY Henry)

This is a simple JavaScript program to check if two strings are anagrams of each other.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd anagram.js
   ```
3. Run the anagram checker:
   ```sh
   node anagram.js
   ```

## Example

```sh
node anagram.js listen silent
```

This will output:

```
true "listen" and "silent" are anagrams.
```
You can change the strings to be checked in the input1 and input2 variables
